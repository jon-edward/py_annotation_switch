# py_annotation_switch
A hack for writing switch statements in type annotations for Python.

## Why should I use this?
You most definitely should not use this in any real capacity, for any project, ever. It is fun as a proof-of-concept, however.

## How do I use this?
Simplest case (ha):
```py
from __future__ import annotations
from annotation_switch
```
